# OnlineStore


As the internet has gained traction through the years, the e-commerce industry has  exploded with sites like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, and countless other online stores. We will be an  application which acts as an online store. This application will be broken up into two parts, one  for serving the customer, and one for serving the owner. The customer-centric side of the  application will allow users to browse, search, and purchase items. The owner-centric side will  allow administrators to add, edit, and delete products, as well as manage orders. Within the  customer side of the application, we will have:  


● functionality for browsing items within their categories, including a sorting and filtering  mechanism for the applicable products. 

● functionality for searching for specific items, and narrowing down a search based on  categories, prices, and other variables.  

● A product page for each product, giving a more detailed overview of the product and an  option to add the product to the user’s cart 

● A cart system which allows the user to check-out their items and provide payment and  shipping information.  

● A user database which allows customers to register and sign in to view their cart and  save personal information for checkout  Within the 

Owner side of the application, we will have:  


● The ability to add a new item, including its name, photos, description, and other details.  

● A functionality to edit or remove existing items  

● An interface in which help the owners manage orders, keeping track of whether or not an  order has been shipped
